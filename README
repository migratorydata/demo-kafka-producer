How to publish compressed messages using Kafka Client Producer

In this example the Kafka client producer sends compressed record data to the kafka server by compressing
data using java builtin `Deflater` class and adds additional information as headers to the record. The C# consumer
receives the messages from push server, uncompressed the data and displays them to the console.

Steps to run the example:

1. From `docker` directory start the Kafka server and MigratoryData server using command `docker compose up`.

2. Start the kafka producer from the root directory of the project using command `./gradlew run`.

3. Go to `dotnet-consumer/consumer` and start the consumer using command `dotnet run`.
